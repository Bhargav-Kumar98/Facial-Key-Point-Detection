## Project Overview

### Introduction
In this project, I will combine my knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. My completed code is able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.
